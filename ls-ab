add 2nd new b line
add new b line1
        print ? instead of nongraphic characters

       --show-control-chars
              show nongraphic characters as-is (the default, unless program is 'ls' and output is a terminal)

       -Q, --quote-name
              enclose entry names in double quotes

       --quoting-style=WORD
              use quoting style WORD for entry names: literal, locale, shell, shell-always, shell-escape, shell-escape-always, c, escape (overrides QUOT‐
              ING_STYLE environment variable)

       -r, --reverse
              reverse order while sorting

       -R, --recursive
              list subdirectories recursively

       -s, --size
              print the allocated size of each file, in blocks

       -S     sort by file size, largest first

       --sort=WORD
              sort by WORD instead of name: none (-U), size (-S), time (-t), version (-v), extension (-X)

       --time=WORD
              with -l, show time as WORD instead of default modification time: atime or access or use (-u); ctime or status (-c); also use specified time
              as sort key if --sort=time (newest first)

       --time-style=TIME_STYLE
              time/date format with -l; see TIME_STYLE below

       -t     sort by modification time, newest first

       -T, --tabsize=COLS
              assume tab stops at each COLS instead of 8

       -u     with -lt: sort by, and show, access time; with -l: show access time and sort by name; otherwise: sort by access time, newest first

       -U     do not sort; list entries in directory order

       -v     natural sort of (version) numbers within text

       -w, --width=COLS
              set output width to COLS.  0 means no limit

       -x     list entries by lines instead of by columns

       -X     sort alphabetically by entry extension

       -Z, --context
              print any security context of each file

       -1     list one file per line.  Avoid '\n' with -q or -b

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       The SIZE argument is an integer and optional unit (example: 10K is 10*1024).  Units are K,M,G,T,P,E,Z,Y (powers of 1024) or KB,MB,...  (powers  of
       1000).

       The  TIME_STYLE  argument  can  be full-iso, long-iso, iso, locale, or +FORMAT.  FORMAT is interpreted like in date(1).  If FORMAT is FORMAT1<new‐
       line>FORMAT2, then FORMAT1 applies to non-recent files and FORMAT2 to recent files.  TIME_STYLE prefixed with 'posix-' takes effect  only  outside
       the POSIX locale.  Also the TIME_STYLE environment variable sets the default style to use.

       Using color to distinguish file types is disabled both by default and with --color=never.  With --color=auto, ls emits color codes only when stan‐
       dard output is connected to a terminal.  The LS_COLORS environment variable can change the settings.  Use the dircolors command to set it.

   Exit status:
       0      if OK,

       1      if minor problems (e.g., cannot access subdirectory),

       2      if serious trouble (e.g., cannot access command-line argument).
